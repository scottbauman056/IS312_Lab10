		<h3>
		Hello! My name is Scott Bauman and welcome to my simple page!
		I am currently a student at CSU Northridge pursuing a degree in Computer Information Technology
		with a minor in Business Management, and am most of the way through my junior year after having
		transferred in from Antelope Valley Community College last year.</br></br>
		
		Although I am pursuing a technology degree, I have an AA in Korean Language Studies from the
		Defense Language Institute: Foreign Language Center from my training as a linguist in the
		USAF, and in similar eclectic fashion I have had several jobs ranging from sales to customer
		service and more, and after getting my bachelors degree my intent is to go into the field of
		computer network administration and architecture. Aside from my CSUN studies I am in the final stages
		of studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification exam, and will soon be studying for my CCNA.</br></br>
		
		Below are a brief list of my currently enrolled classes in table format for ease of reading. Thank you
		for visiting my site!
